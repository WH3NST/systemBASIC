# systemBASIC
This is a language I made a while back while teaching myself assembly. I decided to put it on github since it is kind of interesting. I made a lot of screwed up design choices and I am not working on it anymore. It uses NASM macro's to implement an intermediate language, and lua scripts to put syntax on top of the intermediate language.
